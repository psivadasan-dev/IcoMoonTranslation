# IcoMoonTranslation

This project translates the IcoMoon icons maintained by ZI UXD team into visual icons. 
Thereby, helping developers identify the right icon selectors to use easily.

* The icon css file maintained by UXD team is at `https://i.icomoon.io/public/13394cc478/EngageTellwise/style.css`
* We store a local copy of this file in the `src/icomoon` project folder
* The deployed visualization application can be found [here](https://psivadasan-dev.github.io/IcoMoonTranslation/home)


## Development server

Run `ng serve` for deploying the app in local dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
